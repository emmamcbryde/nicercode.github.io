# Why I want to write nicer code #

Future employment: you should consider anything you write (open or closed) to be a potential advert to a future employer

Find bugs:

- open source helps
- best commercial applications are open source, e.g. military encryption
- open source materials get sued and improved

Scaling up 

- more data, bigger questions. 
- ever decreasing cost of more data, compared to linear cost with bad code/ excel. 

# Showcase #

github, twitter API
Hadley Wickham, large data
diversitree on github

- network via history, Emma Goldberg fork

Poor code: Freckleton MEE http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00220.x

## Key elements of nice code
readability  

- intent (what is it meant to do) --> variable names, comments, design
- style
- don't repeat yourself 

Reliable

- don't repeat yourself, avoiding repetition makes code more reliable
- it runs

Code smell

- global vars


> programs should be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute
> Always code as if the person who will maintain your code is a maniac serial killer that knows where you live

shortcut now is mortgage on your future time

fast, readable, robust, tested, reusable, sharable

> Many future scientific insights are likely to be buried ever more deeply, and subtlety, in ever larger amounts of experimental data. This research-enabling project will develop breakthrough tools to enable new ways to interpret and draw insight from data.
