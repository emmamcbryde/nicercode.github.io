These are the help pages for the
[Genes to Geosciences](http://www.gg.mq.edu.au)
[introduction to R](http://www.gg.mq.edu.au/rep/#GG_R_modules)
module.

Topics we will cover today:

1. [Preliminaries](preliminaries.html): Getting your environment set
   up.
2. [Getting started](getting-started.html): Starting R, using it as
   a calculator, and variables.
3. [Loading data](loading-data.html): Reading in data, viewing, and
   subsetting.
4. [Writing functions](writing-functions.html): Avoiding errors and
   better describing your intent.
5. [Data types](data-types.html): A digression on data types
6. [Repeating things](repeating-things.html): Introduction to ways of
   automating repetitive tasks.

I've collected a few [resources](resources.html) to help you continue
learning.
