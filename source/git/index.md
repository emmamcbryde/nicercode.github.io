Git has a reputation for being hard to learn:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>They say git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space.</p>&mdash; Kornel (@pornelski) <a href="https://twitter.com/pornelski/status/316190292443267073">March 25, 2013</a></blockquote>

One of the things that will make learning git challenging for many
ecologists is that most resources (e.g., the excellent
[git book](http://git-scm.com/book/) assume that you are coming from a
background of using CVS, SVN or some other centralised version control
system.  Therefore, they expect you to already be thinking in one way
and then show you how to translate those ideas into git's ideas.

In a way you're lucky, as you don't have to learn a bunch of stuff and
then unlearn it (e.g., see
[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/embdf/git_complicated_of_course_not_commits_map_to/c196s4w)).
Some of the things that git does just make sense with cheaper (and
more decentralised) bandwidth, disk space, and computing power than
the systems that were developed in the past.
