 Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code 
repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in 
science. One such open source VCS, git, provides a lightweight yet robust 
framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as 
datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts.

Using a good version control system, such as git, is probably the most important
habit you need for writing nicer code. Below you'll find the nicercode guide 
to version control using git, written especially for ecologists who haven't used 
other version control systems before.  (We're using "ecologists" as a shorthand 
here.  It's not an exclusive term -- many geneticists or other scientists will 
have the a similar background, toolset and needs.)

## Other resources

There are many other tutorials and resources about git. Of all of those, these come recommended

- Chapters 1-3 of the excellent [git book](http://git-scm.com/book/)
- [git succinctly](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/git), another free book.
