The default installation of git leaves you with a fairly spartan
interface.  These are some of my tips for making it more pleasant to
use.

Obviously, you need git installed.  Check to see you have it installed
by running `git --version`, which will produce output like this:

```plain
~ Â» git --version
git version 1.7.9.6 (Apple Git-31.1)
```

If not, [install git](install.html) first!

The first thing is to set your name and email.  These will appear all
over the place, so they are good to set up first.  It feels a bit
weird if you're the only person using a reposirory, but you only have
to set this once.  So run

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@domain.com
```

These are *global* options and will affect all repositories.  These
can actually be over-ridden on a per-repository basis, but you don't
generally need to do that.  The configuration options go into the file
`~/.gitconfig` (the `~` means "home" in unix commands).

### Editor
The default editor is [`vi`](http://vim.com) -- if you have used this
before, this will probably be fine, but if not you are in for a rude
shock.  So, next, let's set that to be a better option.  If you want
to stay on the command line, `nano` is a nice lightweight choice.

First, check that you have `nano` installed by typing 

```
which nano
```

and then running

```
git config --global core.editor '/usr/bin/nano'
```

(but change the path to reflect where it is installed.  In most
situations it will be `/usr/bin/nano`).

Whenever git needs you to write a message on a commit, it will pop
open `nano`.  Write the message and quit with `Control-X` (*X* for
*exit*), answering "Y" when prompted to save the file.

Adding the `--tempfile` option will cause `nano` to save on exit
without prompting or asking about the filename.  This can be nice to
avoid being bothered the whole time.

```
git config --global core.editor '/usr/bin/nano --tempfile'
```

However, it removes the ability to easily abort a commit by not saving
the message.

On a Mac, it is possible to use something like "TextEdit" to edit the
file, by running

```
git config --global core.editor 'open -t -n -W'
```

There is a catch though; you have to make sure that you **quit** the
application after writing your message.  The `-n` option means that
this is *new* instance of TextEdit so you won't lose other open work
when doing this at least.

### Colour

By default, the command line is fairly stark, but git has options to
spruce it up with nice colours.  More than just look pretty, these
allow you to much more easily scan output.

Just run

```
git config --global color.ui true
```

and the output of `status` and `diff` (and a few others) will be
coloured for you.

### Localisation

If you want dates in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format (rather than in
Month Day, Year format), run this command

```
git config --global log.date iso
```

(I find ISO dates easier to scan).

### Useful aliases

Git allows you to define aliases for frequently used commands.  So
instead if typing

```
git merge --ff-only somebranch
```

you can just type (for example)

```
git ff somebranch
```

To set up aliases either use `git config` again:

```
git config --global alias.ff 'merge --ff-only'
```

Or edit your `~/.gitconfig` file so it contains a section `[alias]`
like this:

```
[alias]
        ff   = merge --ff-only
```

My full set of aliases is

```
[alias]
        lol = log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
        lola = log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all
        topo = log --graph --simplify-by-decoration --pretty=format:'%d' --all
        ff   = merge --ff-only
        mrg  = merge --no-ff
```

The first (`lol` = "log one line") gives a very quick view of the
history of a repository, including its topology.  `lola` does a
similar thing, but includes remote branches too (and stashes, but
they're usually hard to interpret).  `topo` shows just the topology.

The `ff` alias will merge a commit, but only if a "fast forward"
commit is possible.  Otherwise it will throw an error and I'll think
about doing a rebase or a merge instead.

The `mrg` alias will do a merge *even if a fast forward commit is
possible*.  This is sometimes useful for merging in feature branches
when the main branch has not changed.
