A linear history is fine, but that is often not how science
progresses.

Suppose that you've got your project working, but want to get tidy it
up a bit in a way that requires major surgery and you want to be able
to get back to where you were.

Alternatively, suppose that you want to try two different ways of
implementing something.

In my case, I have a package that I mantain -- sometimes I need to add
bug fixes to the released version without wanting to publish the
broken development code.

In all of these scenarios, we might want to work on a "branch" of the
project.

* Creating branches with `branch` and `checkout -b`
* Switching branches with `checkout`
* How the graph looks
* Combining branches with `merge`
* Combining branches with `rebase`
* The idea of fast-forwarding
* The idea of a nice history
* Creating a branch off an old version
