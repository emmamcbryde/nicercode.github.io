# Reminder about homework.

If people really aren't in a position to reorganise a current project,
other options include: 

1. reorganising a completed project
2. organising a future project
3. set up a dummy project

For the workshop on Tuesday we'll be using a dummy project for most of
the time.

# Getting set up with git.

A reminder; make sure that you have a working Rstudio installation.
Instructions were in the last email.

Download git.

* Go to the git homepage, http://git-scm.com
* Download the current version (release at time of writing is
  1.8.2.1).

Windows users:

* Run the downloaded "exe" file; the installer is a typical windows
  one -- accept the licence (GNU GPL).  The defult options for the
  "Select components" window should be good for everyone.  In
  particular, the "Advanced context menu (git-cheetah plugin)" under
  "Windows Explorer integration" should be selected.  It's up to you
  if you want icons peppered around as Windows likes to do.
* When prompted about "Adusting your PATH environment", select the
  **second** option (Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt).  This
  will help RStudio find git and save a step later.
* Accept the default for line endings; there is no joy to be had here,
  but this is probably the least bad path.

Mac Users:

* Open the downloaded "dmg" file.
* Run the installer "pkg" contained within.  On Mountain Lion, you may
  have to hold down Command and Control when you click, and select
  open to work around the increased security "features".
* There are no useful options, so just click OK through the
  installation.
