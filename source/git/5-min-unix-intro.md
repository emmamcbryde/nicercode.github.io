Git commands require you to use the **shell**.  For people who started
using computers before 1995, this is like the DOS prompt, but
massively more powerful.  It's a bit like R but for managing your
files and programs.  It can also be dangerous, so be careful.  We
don't need many commands, so hopefully this list will do.  We'll add
more if needed.

* `ls`: list files in the current directory
* `cd`: change directory
* `pwd`: print the path to the current directory
* `mv`: move (rename) a file or directory
* `cp`: copy a file (need to pass argument `-r` for directories)

There are many many tutorials on the internet for using the shell.
[Software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) have a great and
very thorough [introduction](http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/shell).
