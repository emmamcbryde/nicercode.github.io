If there is one piece of advice I would recommend keeping in your head when
working with R, it is this:

> Don't Repeat Yourself

Many of the headaches that people end up having stem from repeating
themselves.  This basically mortgages your future time.  It is common to see
cases where people have copy-and-pasted some piece of code a bunch of times
(changing one thing each time), then copy and pasted *that* a bunch of times,
changing it a bit more.  In the end, the script is very long, hard to read,
really hard to understand, and full of bugs.

Believe me on the last case --- you *will* write code that has bugs.  The
more code you write, the more bugs you will have.  The good thing is that
[unlike Excel bugs](http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/the-excel-
depression-20130419-2i486.html), you can see and find them. The other goood
thing is that the less code you write, the more easily you will spot the
bugs.

There are many ways of ensuring that you don't repeat yourself. Mastering the
different approaches can take many years.  However, try to notice when you
feel like you are battling against the language, and you'll get a good hint
for when you should be doing something differently.
