On this blog, I'm hoping to record bits of information about using R
for ecology and evolution.  Communicating tips person-to-person is too
inefficient, and recently helping out at a 
[software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) boot camp has got me
interested in broadcasting ideas more widely.

This is a test.

```r
f <- function(x)
  sin(x)
for ( i in 1:10 )
  print(i)
```

More test
