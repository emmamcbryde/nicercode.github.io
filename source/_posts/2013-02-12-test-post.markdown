On this blog, we (Daniel Falster and I) are hoping to record bits of
information about using R for ecology and evolution.  Communicating
tips person-to-person is too inefficient, and recently helping out at
a [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) boot camp has
got me interested in broadcasting ideas more widely.

Test code:

```r
f <- function(x)
  sin(x)
for ( i in 1:10 )
  print(i)
```

More test for checking the layout.
