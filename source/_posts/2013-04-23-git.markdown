Thanks to everyone who came along and was such good sports with
learning git today. Hopefully you now have enough tools to help you use git in your own
projects. The notes are available (in fairly raw form)
[here](/git). Please let us know where they are unclear and we will
update them.

To re-emphasise our closing message -- start using it on a
project, start thinking about what you want to track, and start
thinking about what constitutes a logical commit.  Once you get into a
rhythm it will seem much easier.  Bring your questions along to the
class in 2 weeks time.

Also, to re-emphasise that git is not a backup system.  Make sure that
you have your work backed up, just in case something terrible happens.
I recommend [crash plan](http://www.crashplan.com/) which you can use
for free for backing up onto external hard drives (and for a fee).

effort to slow down spam bots).  Alternatively, you are welcome to
