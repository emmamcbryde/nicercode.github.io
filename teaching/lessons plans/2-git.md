# Session 2 - Version control with Git, 2013.04.23

## To do

- email: computer setup and installation (blog post), who is collaborating, info for swc people
- write blog post about setup
- try setup on clean mac and PC
- clean up week one blog posts
- RF draft post
- DF to refine
- DF to start blog post on project restructure
- DF using git in Rstudio

## Goal

1. Understand why version control will make their life better

2. Have them using basic git commands (commit, log) on one of their own projects by end of session

3. (optional) 
   - People thinking in terms of feature branches: recognising that I'm about to do something major and switching to a branch, so that you always have a working copy as master
   - can use it collaboratively
   - Seeing what that changed over time - history on bitbucket, github

 
## Outline for session ##

### Why version control

- look at Greg's notes, slides online
- focus more on single user

Possible solution

### Outline workflow

### Graphs

### Single user, linear append only workflow

using git as lab notebook

**Benefits**

- delete legacy code with confidence, keeps directories clean 
- roll back to different versions (e.g. submission, talk, etc), incl correct data 
- confidence to change things, knowing you can easily recover (link to branching) 

### Multiple computers (using bitbucket) 

Set up remote, push, merging

### Synchronous collaboration

merging

Link to Word track changes

### When git brings disaster

What not to try, i.e. avoid trouble



Why bit bucket?

- collaboration
- code archiving
- nice visualisation tools
- backup but only to a degree
- distributing to clusters and other computers (including your own)
