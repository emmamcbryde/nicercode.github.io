# Session 1 - Intro and project setup, 2013.04.09

# Key concepts 
1. Nicer code has benefits, need to pay attention to writing nice code
2. Should be able to pick up a project at any time, understand what files do what, and rerun your analyses


# Outline for session

##Intro 
Why nicer code

Format of course
- who is it for
- feedback what do you want

## Setting up a projects
- simple but important
- no paths hard coded --> can pick up and run at any time. Where useful: moving project folder, SI material for journals, pass to collaborators/supervisor to check, working on another machine
- reusing functions in new projects: 2 

## Planning ahead

Git session

Code review


# Showcase #

github, twitter API
