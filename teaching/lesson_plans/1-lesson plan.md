# Session 1 - Intro and project setup, 2013.04.09

# Key concepts 

1. Nicer code has benefits, need to pay attention to improving your code

2. Should be able to pick up a project at any time, understand what files do what, and rerun your analyses


# Outline for session

##Intro 


Why are you here (round the room)?

- how long using R?
- how often use R?
- Why are you here?
- Research you do

Examples of usage

- scalable, automate
- not taught computer science, habits: focus on doing things, little attention to workflow, habits, nice code
- modern stats no longer point and click
- critical mass of people in department

Why are we teaching nice code

- RF:
- DF: coding for years, met Rich FitzJohn

## Format of course

Who is it for

- already using R
- to get the most, need to try the stuff we're suggesting
- focus more on workflow, habits than tricks

Outline

1. Introduction & project set up (9 April)
2. Version control with git (23 April) -- this will be a longer
session, run with participants from the February software carpentry
bootcamp.
3. Coding style (7 May)
4. Abstraction and design (21 May)
5. Testing code (4 June)

Feedback what do you want

Seek feedback

- packages
- Data matching, models and avoiding duplication
- Higher order functions and functional programming
- The split/apply/combine pattern
- Creating better graphs (many possible sessions here)
- Code reuse and packaging
- Code profiling and optimisation
- Using and creating simple databases
- Text processing
- Numerical optimisation and algorithms
- Simulation models (an intro only!)

## What is nice code ##

Messy: Falster example

###Principles

Nice code is easy to read and write

Nice code is reliable, i.e. bug free

Nice code is fast

Nice is idiomatic - other people can get your intent. More sharable.

All relative

### why you want to write nice code ###

- better science: bigger data, less bugs
- more fun:
- save time: rerunning, reusing, sharing, 
- impact: papers published, CV, jobs,  

## Setting up a projects 

Nicer: Rich's wood project

Simple but important

- no paths hard coded --> can pick up and run at any time. Where useful: moving project folder, SI material for journals, pass to collaborators/supervisor to check, working on another machine
- reusing functions in new projects: 2 

## Planning ahead

Git session

- who is using windows, mac, linux?

Code review

- is it a good idea


## Possible showcase 

Rich - woody plants project
github, twitter API
Hadley Wickham's [bigviz package for working with big data](https://github.com/hadley/bigvis)
diversitree on github: network via history, Emma Goldberg fork

#Post-class reflections

## Who, How long using Why are people here

Doug, 6 months, overwhelmed, vegetation modelling
Vinc, 1 year, stats modelling, plant traits
Dong, 5 months, main tool, mystery, want to write nice code simplify code, 
Dan noble, 4 years, improve programming skills, sexual selection
Eirik, 6 years, improve code, addiction 
Lara, matlab and R, long scripts
Julieta, 3 years, mostly stats, improve prog skills, plant ecol
Marcela, 2 years, improve coding, repetition
Brigitte, 5 months, 3 days per week, coral reef distributions
Toni, 6 months
Georges, 10 years, Rich is very good, forest ecology
Josh, 10 years, can't read old code, corals
Alex, 3 months, 2 times per week, coral fish
Monique, 2 years, improve skills rad
Paolo, 1 year, novel methods
Kate (?), 3 years, daily, script of 3000 lines is inefficient
Andrea, 5 years, don't want 

## What do they want

HIGHER PRIORITY

- The split/apply/combine pattern
- Higher order functions and functional programming
- Code reuse and packaging
- Creating better graphs (many possible sessions here)

ALSO OF INTEREST

- Using a cluster
- Data matching, models and avoiding duplication
- Code profiling and optimisation (5 people have speed issues)
- linking to C++ or fortran (3-5 people)
- Using and creating simple databases
- Text processing
- Numerical optimisation and algorithms
- Simulation models (an intro only!)(3-5 people)

## Reflection

Both agreed it is a success.

Asked 5 students how it went, all suggested that hit the mark in terms of complexity and level.

Things that worked

- conversational style, sitting down, both of us talking / contributing
- class contributed
- had dot point outline (2-3 pages of pdf latex output) of lesson plan, but not too scripted 
- blog post as teaching material worked well: saves rewriting, they can see there are notes for them


Some students struggling to learn general R concepts, because not dedicated time to learning. Applying shotgun and google approach.
--> need to learn problem, and in particular the more general problem, i.e. problem above the one you are working with, not the particular instance you are dealing with now.
