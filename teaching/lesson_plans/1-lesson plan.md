# Session 1 - Intro and project setup, 2013.04.09

# Key concepts 

1. Nicer code has benefits, need to pay attention to improving your code

2. Should be able to pick up a project at any time, understand what files do what, and rerun your analyses


# Outline for session

##Intro 


Why are you here (round the room)?

- how long using R?
- how often use R?
- Why are you here?
- Research you do

Examples of usage

- scalable, automate
- not taught computer science, habits: focus on doing things, little attention to workflow, habits, nice code
- modern stats no longer point and click
- critical mass of people in department

Why are we teaching nice code

- RF:
- DF: coding for years, met Rich FitzJohn

## Format of course

Who is it for

- already using R
- to get the most, need to try the stuff we're suggesting
- focus more on workflow, habits than tricks

Outline

1. Introduction & project set up (9 April)
2. Version control with git (23 April) -- this will be a longer
session, run with participants from the February software carpentry
bootcamp.
3. Coding style (7 May)
4. Abstraction and design (21 May)
5. Testing code (4 June)

Feedback what do you want

Seek feedback

- packages
- Data matching, models and avoiding duplication
- Higher order functions and functional programming
- The split/apply/combine pattern
- Creating better graphs (many possible sessions here)
- Code reuse and packaging
- Code profiling and optimisation
- Using and creating simple databases
- Text processing
- Numerical optimisation and algorithms
- Simulation models (an intro only!)

## What is nice code ##

Messy: Falster example

###Principles

Nice code is easy to read and write

Nice code is reliable, i.e. bug free

Nice code is fast

Nice is idiomatic - other people can get your intent. More sharable.

All relative

### why you want to write nice code ###

- better science: bigger data, less bugs
- more fun:
- save time: rerunning, reusing, sharing, 
- impact: papers published, CV, jobs,  

## Setting up a projects 

Nicer: Rich's wood project

Simple but important

- no paths hard coded --> can pick up and run at any time. Where useful: moving project folder, SI material for journals, pass to collaborators/supervisor to check, working on another machine
- reusing functions in new projects: 2 

## Planning ahead

Git session

- who is using windows, mac, linux?

Code review


# Showcase #

github, twitter API
Hadley Wickham, large data
diversitree on github

- network via history, Emma Goldberg fork

Poor code: Freckleton MEE http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00220.x

- sI material does not work
