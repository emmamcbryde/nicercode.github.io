# Nicer code

  - Are you using R but feel like you are fighting it?
  - Feel like you could be doing something more efficiently?
  - Have analysis scripts that are hundreds of lines of code to
    process your data?
  - Still doing data manuipulation in Excel -- unreplicatable, slow
    and unreliable.

In the nice R code module, we aim to help people take their R coding
to the next level.

Learn good coding and data handling habits, learn new skills.

Our aim is to help you

  - write code more easily
  - avoid common pitfalls
  - have more fun coding, and more time doing science than
    bookkeeping
  - break through barriers allowing you to use bigger data sets
  
If you enjoyed the software carpentry bootcamp, this picks up there
but with a more biological/R focus.

We will cover topics varying from:

- data management
  - graphing
  - version control
  - reproducibility
  - using and creating databases
  - parallel programming
  - simulations and randomisation
  - whatever people are interested in
